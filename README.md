# My First Git repo

**Hello Guys,**

This is my first Git repository to get started with Git. I have linked my local **test project** to this repo.  
Here is a little story about how I end up using Git Hub, so please read on...  

I am a **masters** student at **University of Leicester, UK** pursuing Advance Computer Science.  
I also work as a software Engineer in a textile inspection company. I am tech-lover by nature and believe in `Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish` ideology.  

I have a **bachelor’s degree** in *Electronics and communication engineering*. As electronics and computer science are related disciplines, I developed my interest in programming during my engineering days and after graduation I completed various courses on Coursera and Edx to strengthen my knowledge in Computer science. Now I possess more than 3 years of expertise in programming with various languages i.e. C++, MATLAB, Python and C#.  

Currently, I am working on my master’s degree final project which is based on **_Deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks_**. As a hungry human being, I decided to take courses on ML and Deeplearning.ai specialization by **Dr. Andrew Ng** on coursera. In one of his videos, he advised to take advantage of Open Source community work in the area to apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and practices in your application domain.  

I was not new to version control system as I have been using SVN and Perforce for about a year now but Git's *distributed revision control system* makes it different than SVN. I also realized that Git is very useful to make contributions to the open source community and in turn to the public.  

So I decided to join Git and as a `Hello World` task, here is my first GIT repo. I seek your help and support to better understand Git. Hopefully this is just a beginning of my wonderful journey in open source community.  

Thanks for reading through the end.
